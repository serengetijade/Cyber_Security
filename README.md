# Cyber Security
A repository for cyber security projects such as penetration testing and incident reports. The included projects demonstrate cyber security prinicples regarding protecting databases and keeping the back end secure, developing secure software and apps, protecting user data, and finding vulnerabilities in existing applications.

### Virtual Box Virtual Environments
VirtualBox is software for virtualizing the x86 computing architecture to run virtual environments. It allows for potentially malicious software to be explored in a contained, isolated environment without infecting the main host computer. 

### Kali Linux 
Kali Linux is an OS dedicated to ethical hacking and fiddling with networking utilities. It has a collection of security and forensics tools. It was deployed within Virtual Box to text for malware. Version: Linux 6.1.0-kali5-amd64.

### Wireshark
WireShark is a network analysis tool that is especially useful for cyber security operations analysts. It is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.

### Burp Suite
As a cyber security professional, it is essential to be familiar with penetration and vulnerability testing software. One of the most popular available is Burp Suite. It was used for intercepting network traffic, modifying the HTTP request data sent to the web server, injecting payloads, and testing responses.

### Virus Total and Hybrid Analysis
[Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/) and [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/) are two online scanners that analyzes files and URLs for viruses, worms, trojans and other kinds of malicious content. Hybrid Analysis is useful for older types of maleware. 

## Sprint Overview
During a two-week sprint, my tasks were to analyze security breaches as well as test applications for vulnerabilities. I was responsible for finding malware and how it was introduced to the network, as well as performing ethical hacking techniques to identify security weaknesses in an online retail application. The sprint used real-world security exploitations and [OWASP testing playground](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/). Specific tasks were assigned by the sprint leader, to be completed within a certain timeframe and meeting set parameters.

- Sprint duration: 2 weeks
- 23 stories completed
- Daily stand-ups
- Weekly code retrospectives
- Discord for chat and troubleshooting
