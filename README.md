### Wireshark
WireShark is a network analysis tool that is especially useful for cyber security operations analysts. It is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.

### Burp Suite
As a cyber security professional, it is essential to be familiar with penetration and vulnerability testing software. One of the most popular available is Burp Suite. It was used for intercepting network traffic, modifying the HTTP request data sent to the web server, injecting payloads, and testing responses.

### Virus Total and Hybrid Analysis
[Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/) and [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/) are two online scanners that analyzes files and URLs for viruses, worms, trojans and other kinds of malicious content. Hybrid Analysis is useful for older types of maleware. 

## Sprint Overview
During a two-week sprint, team members were tasked with adding functionality to an existing Web App. I was responsible for uploading images to be used as blog photos, and creating a section for comments and sub comments with asynchronous like/dislike buttons. Full, custom styled, CRUD functionality was required. The sprint was real-world experience as part of a large, multi-person group project. Specific tasks were assigned by the sprint leader, to be completed within a certain timeframe and meeting set parameters.
